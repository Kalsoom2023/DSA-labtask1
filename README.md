# DSA-labtask1lab 1 # Data Structures and Algorithms Lab - Basics

Welcome to the *Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Lab*! This lab is designed to help you understand and implement fundamental concepts in DSA. The exercises will provide hands-on experience with basic data structures and algorithms, forming the foundation for more advanced topics.

## Objectives
- Understand basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- Learn to implement simple algorithms like searching and sorting.
- Gain familiarity with writing and debugging efficient code.

## Topics Covered
1. *Introduction to Data Structures*
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
2. *Basic Algorithms*
   - Linear Search
   - Binary Search
   - Bubble Sort
   - Selection Sort
3. *Stack and Queue Basics*
   - Stack Operations (Push, Pop, Peek)
   - Queue Operations (Enqueue, Dequeue)

## Lab Exercises
### 1. Arrays
- Write a program to perform the following operations on arrays:
  - Insert an element
  - Delete an element
  - Search for an element

### 2. Linked Lists
- Implement a singly linked list with the following functionalities:
  - Insert a node (at the beginning, at the end, or at a given position)
  - Delete a node
  - Display the list

### 3. Searching Algorithms
- Implement *Linear Search* and *Binary Search* to search for an element in an array. Compare their performance.

### 4. Sorting Algorithms
- Implement the following sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Display the sorted array and the number of comparisons made.

### 5. Stacks and Queues
- Implement a stack using arrays or linked lists. Include the following operations:
  - Push
  - Pop
  - Peek/Top
- Implement a queue using arrays or linked lists. Include the following operations:
  - Enqueue
  - Dequeue

## Requirements
- A C++/Python/Java compiler or interpreter installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of programming constructs (loops, functions, etc.).

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   
2. Navigate to the desired program folder.
3. Compile and execute the code:
   - For C++:
     bash
     g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name
     ./program_name
     
   - For Python:
     bash
     python program_name.py
     
   - For Java:
     bash
     javac ProgramName.java
     java ProgramName
     

## Learning Outcomes
- Develop a solid foundation in fundamental data structures.
- Understand and implement basic algorithms for searching and sorting.
- Learn to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms.
